Key Points

Data is the moat for any successful directory — and with Claude Code plus Crawl4AI, the hardest part (data cleaning and enrichment) is now dramatically faster and cheaper.
Every successful directory helps people save time, save money, or make money — and price transparency is a massive, underserved opportunity across boring niches.
Frey built a fully enriched luxury restroom trailer directory in four days for under $250, a process that would have taken 2,000+ hours of manual work.
Monetization depends on the niche: lead generation, vertical SaaS, agency services, ads, debit cards, affiliate, and marketplace models all work.
Directories remain strong in an AI search world because users browsing a directory are in the decision-making phase, especially in high-stakes niches like health, legal, finance, and senior living.
Building a directory is one of the best playgrounds to learn Claude Code, SEO, and lead generation — even if the first one is just a learning exercise.

Intro
0:00
So, you want to start a startup that does anywhere between $2,000 and $10,000 a month passive revenue. Something that
0:07
only have to work on 10, 15, 20 minutes a week, but you don't have a lot of money to start. Maybe you have $200,
0:13
$500, $1,000. Well, what kind of business would you start? I would recommend an online directory. A
0:21
directory is basically a website with a bunch of different links and data. And in this episode, I talk about how you
0:27
can use Claude Code to actually build an online directory that is going to get
0:34
traffic on autopilot. And I brought on Frey and Frey is Mr. Directory. And he shows us step by step
0:41
how to use Claude Code to create a very big directory. I really enjoyed having
0:48
him just take us through the entire process. what are the prompts he uses? How to think about data enrichment? How
0:55
do you think about cleaning the data so that you can create a online directory that generates traffic every single day?
1:02
Now, I know what some people are thinking. They're thinking that's really boring. An online directory, come on. I
1:07
want to build a mobile app. I want to build a SAS product. But what they miss is that building an online directory is
1:14
going to get you thousands of visitors on autopilot. And once you have that,
1:20
then go and vive code a SAS product. Then go and vive code an app. In the
1:25
beginning of this episode, we share multiple examples of people making millions of dollars a year using online
1:31
directories. And some of them have apps that go with it, too. So, this is an
1:38
incredibly important yet boring episode of the podcast, but those who stick to
1:43
the end, I think, are going to have an unfair advantage. I totally recommend you take this link and share it with a
1:48
friend because this is alpha that is not shared anywhere else on the planet.
1:54
You're in for a treat. Enjoy this episode with Frey.
2:04
It is a treat because we have Frey on the pod by the end of this episode. What
2:10
are people going to get out of it? Yeah, thanks for having me on by the way, Greg. Um, yeah, by the end I really
What you’ll learn
2:17
want people to have a solid understanding of how to use cloud code to build AI coded directories with an
2:24
emphasis on what I think is the hardest part, which is getting the valuable data. And we're going to go deep on
2:30
that. But first, I think it's only fair we run it back. The last time I was on the pod, we played a game where I showed
2:36
you a few cool directories and you guessed the traffic. So, if you're down,
2:41
I'll share three cool directories. And if you want, you can try to guess the way that these monetize as well, just
2:48
cuz I think that'd be pretty fun. So, I'll go ahead and share my screen and we can dive into it.
2:55
Let's do it. I can't say no to a game, Frey. You know that.
Directory Game:Parting(Funeral Home Directory)
3:01
All right. So, the first one is parting.com. And we can see it's a funeral home
3:06
directory. This is kind of what it looks like. Click around.
3:12
And how much traffic do you think that this website makes?
3:18
Well, it does say it's the number one. If you go to the
3:24
if you go back to the homepage, I think it says the number one funeral home comparison website for price and
3:30
quality. Um, I'm going to guess it gets at least
3:35
100,000 visits a month. That is a solid guess. Let's take a
3:40
look. All right. All right. 61,000 organic
3:47
monthly visitors. So, pretty close. And what's really cool about this directory,
3:53
I'll kind of share a little bit um about this one is um by the way, any guesses
3:59
on how this might monetize? I'm just curious before I go into this. Well, two things. I did see some ads pop
4:06
up, but I don't think that's where they're getting the bulk of the revenue. I would say it's a lead genen uh
4:12
directory, so they sell leads to funeral homes.
4:17
Yeah, that is partially it. Definitely the ads don't make up the bulk of the revenue. So,
4:23
this is reported to do over a million a year in revenue. There's some quotes
4:29
that go up to $5 million, but they even raised money. They raised $1.5 million
4:34
in 2021. Um, but the bulk of their money actually comes from a software. And if we look at
4:44
Parting Pro, this is kind of their vertical SAS that they offer for
4:50
cremation arrangement software for funeral homes. Um, what's really like
4:55
interesting about this is like this software just helps them do things like
5:01
dropshipping earns. Like that's that's a thing. And then it's kind of got an
5:06
agency backend where they just help you create the website and then do online marketing. Basically lead generation.
5:12
And I think we talked about this last time, but I still believe that building a directory and creating a microsass or
5:19
vertical SAS is a super solid way to go about it. And with cloud code, it's never been easier. Um, but the agency
5:27
directory combo is a potent one. And I see it all the time. Some of the biggest
5:32
directories that I know monetize this way. Uh, but yeah, this is what's bringing in the majority of it. So, um,
5:40
yeah, that's the first one. Solid guess. Let's move on to the second one. Drag it
Directory Game: A Place for Mom (Senior Living Directory)
5:46
over here. This one's called a place formom.com and senior living. Massive industry.
5:54
What are your thoughts on this one? Is it just for moms or for dads, too? You know, what about dad?
5:59
That's what I'm saying. It's messed up. That's messed up. It's for everyone, hopefully.
6:05
Yeah. Um, I would say 50,000 visits a month or more.
6:11
Okay. And are you thinking lead generation as well? Yes. Uh, there's a huge business around
6:20
lead genen for senior living. Um, it's it's a huge business. Um, and
6:27
there's huge publicly traded REITs, real estate investment trusts that, you know, you can see how much
6:33
they spend on marketing. But yeah, there's a it's a big business, massive space, and you know, care.com,
6:40
that's the famous one. Uh, let's take a look. So, place form.com is getting 8
6:46
and24,000 organic monthly visitors. The estimates on this are wild. Like, some
6:53
some websites claim that this makes anywhere between like $100 million a year, $500 million a year. Um, my gut
7:02
tells me like $50 million a year is probably right where I I feel like it's
7:08
more more accurate. And um, the way they monetize is basically purely from lead
7:14
generation. So, they have 18,000 or over 18,000 um senior living homes that are
7:21
listed on their directory and they basically have all of these kind of sneaky ways to collect information and
7:28
then pass them off to these senior living homes where they collect a portion of the first month's rent or
7:34
like a fixed fee for every referral that they give. Um, so just a beastly but
7:40
very simple and straightforward directory and like super classic. Like I think most people think of lead
7:45
generation when people think of directories. So I love this one. It's just so wellm made. It's also built on
7:51
WordPress I believe. So for the WordPress users out there, this is some inspiration. Um, so just a really cool
7:58
one. And uh, I'll leave the last one over here. The last one's going to be
Directory Game: GasBuddy (Crowdsourced Gas Price Directory)
8:04
gasbuddy.com. It's a crowdsourced directory to give
8:10
you gas prices near you. So if you type in like a random zip code, you can just
8:17
find the gas prices, save some money, and it's as simple as that. So what are
8:24
you thinking on this one as far as traffic?
8:29
Uh this is this is a big one, dude. Like I I see right here 100 million downloads
8:35
and counting. I've heard of Gas Buddy. I think that this
8:40
like data moat is a really interesting one just as like a business. Um I'm a
8:48
co-founder of an agency called LCA and we build some really popular AI products and like one one that we're working on
8:53
right now is called Stretch AI. So, it's grocery prices um around you and it's by the co-ound uh
9:01
one of the top guys at Ways which is also a data play. So, anyways, point is I think that if you're number one, you
9:09
have the data mode. This is getting I'm going to I'm going to say one I'm going
9:14
to say three million. No, I'm gonna say two million visits a month. It's like that's that's a good amount. I
9:21
mean Okay. Yeah. But that's that's actually a really good guess. Um, and I totally agree. I I think on the surface
9:28
this looks simplistic, but everyone needs gas. I mean, pretty much everyone. But this directory is getting 1.1
9:34
million organic monthly visitors, and they monetize in two main ways. They
9:39
make a ton of money on ads. So, um, with this amount of traffic and tier one
9:44
traffic coming from the US and Canada, yeah, they're probably I wouldn't be surprised if they're pulling in like on
9:51
the lower end, $30,000 a month just in ads, uh, which if we clicked around we'd
9:57
start seeing, but their big play is actually a debit card. And so, um, if we
10:05
go over to Gas Buddy Plus Premium, they have this debit card that they partnered
10:10
up with Mastercard to create, and it basically allows you to save money on gas. It's $10 a month or $99 a year. And
10:19
so, they have a ton of members here. I love this one. This is my favorite one of the list because
10:26
I think crowdsourcing gas prices is so simple but extremely difficult. So, I
10:31
went back to 2004. They started in 2002, but I wanted to understand how they even
10:38
incentivized people to get gas prices cuz that's like why would anyone want to take time out of their day? And um back
10:46
in 2004, all they did was create a public leaderboard, which they still have today. If we go to gas tools here,
10:54
we can see all these people uh Prince 33 leading the pack and um they basically
11:00
did giveaways. So in 2004, they gave away ebikes. And the way that it would
11:06
work is that if you updated or reported any gas prices, you'd get like 150
11:12
points and then once you reach 1,000 points, that gives you one entry into the giveaway. And they were like, "Yeah,
11:18
you could get an ebike." So I thought that was super interesting. It's like very simple psychology. Everyone loves a
11:24
public leaderboard. We all can't be Usain Bolt, but if you want to be the best gas price reporter in the world,
11:30
then you know you can be that. And let me see if I can quickly find the Wayback
11:38
Machine tab here. Yeah. So, check this out. I thought this was kind of cool. So, this
11:46
is a Yeah. So this is a snapshot from 2006 and we can see this little
11:52
leaderboard here. Prince 33 was active back 20 years ago. Gary Indiana, shout
12:00
out. But now, you know, consistency, persistence has gotten him to number
12:07
one. And what's insane is this guy hasn't missed a day in almost like in over 5,800 days. Like this guy wakes up
12:14
and he's passionate about gas prices apparently. Um, and uh, it's just insane
12:19
to see the super fans. These days, they do give you the giveaways in ebikes
12:25
anymore. They give away $100 prepaid debit cards for gas. Um, but I just
12:31
thought this was super interesting and um, it's actually a rare case where the
The Data Moat Thesis
12:37
directory monetization is super aligned with the reason why
12:43
users are coming to this website. Cuz a place form.com, Partarding.com, they
12:48
have to go and do like outbound sales to like reach out to business owners and create an offer that way. But these guys
12:54
just were really creative with it. Um, so I love this example. And I wanted to show you these three
13:01
because like all three of these directories execute this framework that I think all successful directories do
13:07
which is they help people save time, save money or help people make money.
13:13
And if you look on every any one of these like listing pages here, we can
13:20
see like more specifically, they've done a really good job with
13:26
bringing price transparency as a form of data enrichment in areas where it's just
13:31
really hard to get pricing information. And I think this is actually a massive
13:36
opportunity for directories. It's incredibly unscalable and manual, but there's so many industries and niches
13:43
where price transparency just doesn't exist. Um, tons of boring ones. And so
13:50
for me this year, I think like data can be a moat. It can be a differentiator.
13:56
And price transparency is a big one because it's so hard to get. Um, so
Luxury Restroom Trailers: The Niche Directory Demo
14:03
that kind of leads me into what I wanted to show you guys today, which is how to get valuable data. And
14:11
let me just switch tabs over here to what I built. Um, let's do this. Good
14:20
segue because I'm I'm bought in on on the thesis. Like I I agree. I think the
14:26
data is the moat. I also think that you can use AI in clever ways to get the
14:31
data. So, uh I'm intrigued for I'm intrigued.
14:38
Yeah, it's it's um it's definitely the most boring part. And the reason it was
14:43
actually kind of hard to decide what I wanted to talk about cuz with cloud code, you're doing so many things that I
14:50
wanted to go deep rather than wide. But um yeah, I would say for directories the moat is definitely data and your SEO
14:58
like if you have really strong backlinks. Um uh but yeah, like also just quickly
15:06
another reason I wanted to show you those three directories is because I think the number one question that I saw reading the comments from the last pod
15:13
was how do you monetize these directories? And the answer is really unsexy, but it depends on the niche. And
15:20
I don't think it has to be display ads or lead genen. It obviously can be really creative. I've seen tons of
15:26
different offers created on the back end of directories, but um yeah, it's it's
15:31
super cool. So anyways, I built this directory in 4 days and it
15:38
literally started from a raw massive unorganized
15:43
CSV of data of over 70,000 rows that I scraped for the entire country um for
15:50
portaotty suppliers. And I just wanted to start with an example where I show
Before & After: WordPress Directory vs. Claude Code Directory
15:55
you what a directory might look like with high quality data and one that looks Yeah. and what one would look like
16:02
with lowquality data. So, let's just start with this one. This
16:07
is my cloud code directory. Luxury restroom trailers. Boring but awesome niche. People are spending $1,000,
16:14
$2,000 a day renting these out for their weddings. You know, there's corporate
16:20
events, film sets, really all sorts of stuff. just kind of showing you what you
16:26
can create in record time. And um yeah,
16:31
the listing looks great, super super clear with the amenities and features. We have some images, the types of stalls
16:38
that you can go and rent, and then of course the lead form, some service areas, and I think this looks solid. But
16:46
let me take you a year and a half back when I didn't know Claude Code and I created this beauty. This is
16:53
portaottymatch.com. I built this in WordPress and it still has Lauram Ipsum
16:59
on the front page. You know, we got some listing pages that are looking pretty
17:04
sparse and all of this is just AI generated. Like sentence structures all
17:10
the same. It's a bad directory. It's ugly. It's bad. All these images are the same for every listing.
17:18
So, I built this thinking like no one could reasonably trust this directory and like inbound as a lead, right? But
17:26
to my surprise, I just built this and left it up and I got like
17:34
some leads coming in. And this is one example here. Kind of blocked out the
17:40
email, but I actually got a bunch of leads that just inbounded. Uh, this guy named Eric wanted a restroom trailer. uh
17:47
for with multiple stalls. Um he has a film shoot. So that was kind of a cool
17:52
way to look at the use cases. Another film shoot guy coming in asking for a
17:58
trailer for a film shoot. Uh Martha looking for a reasonably priced
18:04
portaotty with a sink or handwash station. And then this is the big one. I got a
18:09
lead from the New Mexico State Fair. This is the order that they wanted. And
18:16
this is like $20,000 plus of porta potty/luxury
18:21
restroom trailers that they wanted. So just an insane lead and um I was
18:28
surprised. So despite my really poor data curation,
18:34
it kind of just showed me that there is a massive need in this space and it's
18:40
not really easy to go and compare the different portaotty types if you're in the market for one and there's also like
18:47
a vast amount of like use cases. Um, but I knew that things were kind of falling through the cracks. And so if all these
18:55
leads inbounded with this crappy looking directory with Lauram Ipsum on the front page, what would it look like if I
19:01
actually built this thing out now that I know Cloud Code? So, I vibecoded this
Cost Breakdown: Built in 4 Days for Under $250
19:06
kind of how I built this directory that outlines this sevenstep process on how
19:12
I'm using cloud code and an open- source GitHub repo called craw for AAI to
19:19
handle any kind of data curation. So, this is where I kind of just want to show people how to tackle that data side
19:26
because I've seen probably a thousand or 2,000 people build directories in the
19:31
last year. And 100% this is where people either quit or give up. And I totally
19:37
empathize. There was a point in my life where I was waking up and being like, "All right, I'm going to sit down in
19:43
this chair for 6 hours and click on this website and just manually verify if this is a luxury restroom trailer." And it
19:50
was hell. like it was awful. Terrible, terrible use of time. But as we can see
19:55
from these stats, I mean, I built this in 4 days. Like I mentioned, I probably saved over 2,000 hours in what would
20:01
have been manual data cleaning, manual data enrichment. Also, record low costs.
20:06
I mean, I would have to hire a developer to like write custom Python scripts before, and it's just not necessary
20:13
nowadays. So, I built this in under 250 bucks. $100. Yeah, $100 of that was my
20:20
Claude Code Max subscription. Another $100 was for the data. Um, and then $50
20:27
for some Clawude API credits to do some deep cleaning, which we'll talk about in a moment. So, all you really need to get
20:34
started is your directory niche. Mine's luxury restroom trailers. You need cloud
20:40
code and you want an understanding of what drives decision-m like what do
20:45
people actually need to make a decision around a luxury restroom trailer and you can just achieve that by looking at
20:51
Reddit forums I think Tik Tok's great Facebook groups Instagram anywhere where the conversation online is being had
20:58
around these uh around the topic that you're building your directory around. So, as we can see, like this whole
21:06
process I'm about to go over is just the second step for me. I think my structured approach to building
21:12
directories starts with finding the idea, collecting the data, building the website, SEO optimiz SEO optimization,
21:20
and then figuring out monetization. So, let's just start with the first step.
Step 1: Scraping Raw Data with Outscraper
21:25
The first step is just scraping the data. I just went straight to outs scraper. I don't think
21:33
there's nothing new here. I went over this in the last uh pod, but out scraper
21:38
is still the cheapest option for me. I've used ampify and other kind of alternatives, but just keep it simple. I
21:45
think out scraper is a great place to start and there's tons of videos online where people can learn how to scrape
21:51
data with from Google Maps using out scraper. So, I went and did this. I got
21:57
71,000 rows and potential listings and cover the entire state. I build
22:03
nationwide directories and the whole game plan is to sell leads um in this high ticket niche. So, pretty
22:10
straightforward. The problem is 71,000 rows is massive and we definitely have to do a lot of
22:18
cleaning as far as data goes. So this is when I introduced cloud code into the
22:23
mix and I used to have to manually clean data and I would have all of the obvious
Step 2: Cleaning Data with Claude Code
22:29
junk data removed. So remove things like listings with no business name, address,
22:35
city, state, permanently closed ones, and any like obvious ones that don't
22:40
relate to my niche like big box retailers. And so this is the prompt that I wrote.
22:46
And uh obviously people are going to have to kind of retrofit this to your own niche, but I'm just telling Cloud
22:52
Code, here are my five CSVs. Go ahead and just look at every single one and
22:58
use this criteria to clean the data. And so this simple prompt got me from 71K
23:07
down to 20,000 listings. And if you are going to use this prompt, I think anyone
23:12
can benefit from this particular part, which is just getting rid of obvious
23:18
junk data. And um yeah, what we're left with is
23:23
just still a massive piece of data. So the next round is where it gets a little
Step 3: Using Crawl4AI for Automated Website Verification
23:30
bit more interesting. And this was like where I had the biggest problem a couple
23:36
years back, which is, okay, we have 20,000 potential portaotty businesses.
23:41
I've kind of exhausted all of my ways to kind of superficially clean the data. And so at this point, I need a way to
23:48
automate the process of manually going to every single website and verifying whether or not these are luxury restroom
23:56
trailers. And so the way that I did that is I installed Crawford AI. This is an
24:01
open-source LLM friendly web crawler and scraper, totally free, which is insane.
24:07
And this is something that you just install locally to your computer. I'm
24:13
brand new to uh I'm brand new to AI coding, like I'm only 6 months in. And so if you're just getting started, the
24:20
way that I literally did it is just took this link, gave it to Cloud Code, and told it to help me install it. And it
24:26
took about 15 minutes. So now that we have this installed, crawl for AI is
24:31
kind of the engine that allows us to at scale look at every single website and
24:37
then cloud code is the brain. So we can prompt cloud code and say look at every single one of these 20,000 websites and
24:45
just go and identify the luxury restroom trailers. So, as a quick little demo
24:52
here, um, oops. I'll just pull up my cloud code here.
24:59
And I just wanted to show people the workflow instead of just talking about it. U, but I I'll just do it on a
25:05
smaller sort of sample size. So, here's a CSV of just 10 restroom trailers or
25:12
sorry, here's an example of 10 portaotty companies. And basically, I'm trying to
25:18
figure out which ones are restroom trailers and which ones aren't. So, I'm going to go ahead and just run that
25:25
prompt that I showed you here. And I'll just copy and paste it here.
25:32
And you're not very technical from what I remember. I'm not I'm not like that's
25:38
the funny part is like when I learned cloud code it was like even to this day I don't
25:46
really think I use cloud code um to what
25:51
it could be. But yeah, like I've still been able to accomplish like a ton and um
25:59
yeah, I probably should explore other other tools, but I just try to keep it
26:05
simple and do it well. Um with tools like this. So yeah, I'm totally non-technical, which hopefully
26:13
gives any reason to anyone watching this who's less technical to learn cloud code because if I can do it, I can. You
26:19
definitely can do it. Um, so I used cash results, so this came back super fast. But basically, I gave it 10 businesses.
26:26
Here we can see it identified three luxury candidates and seven standard portaotties. But it might take longer if
26:33
you run it for the first time. And essentially, I just kind of told it to
26:39
um go through this, go through every single website and identify like
26:44
restroom trailer related keywords. So, it's kind of helpful to know like all the synonyms
26:50
of the keyword you're trying to look for. And um a couple pro tips if you are
26:56
using crawl for AAI, there's extra modules that you can add, including this one. And this is one of a
27:04
few that I used, but async webcrawler allows you to just crawl multiple
27:11
websites concurrently. That saves a ton of time. Uh, but yeah, this was kind of
27:17
the point where I was like, "Oh, snap. This is insane and I can't believe it's free because I set this up in probably
27:24
15 20 minutes. I wrote this prompt by just talking to Chad GBT
27:29
and then it just ran in the background for 3 hours and this is really what would have taken me like a,000 hours
27:36
just a couple years back. So, the result was 20,000 websites down
27:42
to 725 luxury restroom trailers. We can see the
27:48
CSV here. And um yeah, it even gives us
27:53
like verification confidence. It's just nice. It is it's nice with it. Like I I saw this and I was like, this is so
27:59
cool. Um but that's not it. And that's not really enough to build a directory. So, we move
Step 4: Enriching Trailer Inventory Data
28:06
on to step four. And this is when we get into trailer inventory.
28:11
For me, that's trailer inventory. But for you, it's just like for you, it's the first round of data enrichment.
28:17
Like, I need to figure out all of these 725 restroom trailers. What
28:24
do they offer? like what's what like if you look online most people are looking for two stall and three stall trailers
28:31
because those are good enough to cater to like a 50 to 100 person wedding but some people are looking for more and so
28:38
I wrote this prompt again it's very casual you can tell that I just had a conversation with chatbt
28:45
and I just used crawl for AI in the same way but this time instead of looking for keywords like restroom trailer I told it
28:53
to look for the full like fleet of products that a
28:58
business offers. And um yeah, so I
29:04
believe I have a prompt as well. Um we can actually just take this
29:11
right over here just to show people. I won't do this for every single one, but just to show people kind of the
29:16
workflow. I can say um let's take those
29:22
three candidates for luxury restroom trailers
29:27
and uh use this prompt. I'll just do that. And this prompt again is just telling it
29:33
to go and find all the different types of luxury restroom trailers that a business
29:39
offers. And I do like to add to just like get Claude Code's opinion. Give me your game plan. Tell me if I'm missing
29:46
anything. and just let me know before we we go for
29:52
it. Before we burn tokens, before we burn tokens and we have to
29:57
upgrade our claw. Um, yeah. So,
30:03
this is basically um
30:08
Yeah. So, uh, cool. Yeah. So, yeah, it basically came back with
30:14
A1 containers. There's a two stall trailer and a four stall trailer. Again, this is going to take more time, but you
30:21
can set up whatever logic you want. And actually, there's a lot of nuance with
30:27
this process. So, just to kind of go over that, like there's a ton of edge cases that you want to check after every
30:34
single pass. And one of the first mistakes that I did when I started enriching my data with craw for AI was I
30:40
would just give it this massive laundry list of things to get and just gave it like a massive CSV and I was like get
30:47
the trailer inventory, get the images, get any amenities, features, pricing, all of that stuff and it just didn't
30:54
work. Like it was super low quality. Um so that's why I'm kind of going slowly
31:01
one at a time. And this is also helpful cuz after this pass, I could examine the
31:07
results. You always find edge cases, just these one-off situations where you
31:13
should let Claude Code know that it messed up. It done messed up so that you can fix it. And um you might have to
31:21
rerun this. I reran this, I think, two or three times until pretty much all of
31:26
my data was good and I had all of the stall information for every single
31:32
listing. Um, so yeah, this this process just continues one by one for me. The next
Step 5: Scraping & Verifying Images with Claude Vision
31:38
one was trailer images. And this one was cool because not only did I use craw for
31:44
AAI to scrape the images from the business websites, which by the way I know is a gray area, but I plan to go
31:50
and reach out to these businesses and ask for permission and just have them claim the listing, which basically gives
31:58
them um gives us the uh you know green light to use this. But you can scrape
32:04
the images. And what I did was I just told Claude Code to look for any alt text file names, examine the page that
32:12
it's on, and scrape the highest quality images. And then what I did is I told it
32:19
to create um I told it to take the top three candidates for trailer images and
32:25
then I just sent it over to Claude Vision. And this way it was able to look
32:31
at these images and identify the best ones because the first time I did this I got like logos
32:38
and crappy images and favicons and it was like am I really about to clean this
32:44
image data? Like this sounds so bad. And this is the workaround that I came up
32:49
with. This cost about $30. All I had to do was go to Claude and connect my API
32:54
key. Super simple. And this is the prompt that I used. Uh, I let this run overnight, but yeah,
33:02
this took probably about an hour or so for 700 listings. So, if we take a look,
33:07
this is kind of where we're getting brick by brick. We're just starting to get all of this good information. Stalls
33:16
and all the green um columns here are kind of the ones that are valuable. Let
33:22
me see if uh Oh, yeah. Yeah. So, all of the Yeah, all
33:28
of the green highlighted columns are of the images and I think it did a really
33:33
great job. So, um if we just click on any one of these,
33:39
they're pretty solid. And this was not the case the first time.
33:44
So, we're starting to see how this comes together. Just just on the
33:49
uh scraping image piece, you know, I I'm not a lawyer. I don't play to be one on the internet. Frey not
33:56
to my knowledge is a lawyer. Is that correct? I am not. He is not. Uh so I think you know but I
34:06
but I think that you if you scrape people's images you are the only way
34:11
you're well let me take a step back. You you're supposed to have the rights for
34:16
images that you post on your websites, right? Um so
34:22
sometimes those rights are available like you know if you look at the terms
34:28
of services of some websites those are available and sometimes these are these are like small local businesses so
34:33
chances are they might not even have a terms of service. Um so so yeah just so
34:40
you know there is some risk associated with scraping images without the rights.
34:46
Totally. Yeah. And I think you don't even need images for a directory to rank
34:52
and get traffic. I just kind of wanted to show this use case. And I'm sure there's ways and there's different
34:57
niches where you can scrape images where it's less risky. Um, you know, public
35:03
images and such. Uh, or you can just use like stock images. I mean, we saw from my crappy little directory, no pun
35:09
intended, like this got leads without needing a ton of images on the listings.
35:15
So, um, 100% not advocating for this and
35:20
definitely some risk. So, just know that going in. And I think that was a good shout out.
35:26
Before we get to the next step, I just want to make a quick note about your quote unquote crappy
35:32
other website. Yeah, I will say the logo on this website does slap. you've got this mascot
35:40
uh and he he he he feels very approachable and and interesting. So I
35:47
am feeling I don't know if the audience feels the same way. I am feeling a bit of a loss of a little character in the
35:53
new you know fancy Apple style website 100%. I worked I worked hard on this
36:00
little guy and um yeah, I just generated it with Chat GBT and I'm sure you can
36:05
use Nano Banana for this, but yeah, I'm actually planning on bringing this guy
36:11
over and um adding some human touch to this directory cuz it's definitely
36:16
unfinished. It's probably like 60% finished. But I I appreciate that. That's a that's a compliment to my
36:23
creative side which which does exist in the world of directories but it's just uh maybe less common but
36:32
yeah like just kind of going back to this though it like the process just kind of continues stacking like it did
Step 6: Amenities, Features & Filter Data
36:38
this with the amenities and features again like the process wasn't smooth the
36:45
first time it would miss some amenities and features here and there but this is the very casual prompt that I wrote. Um,
36:53
basically just, you know, mentioned that the first time I ran this, it didn't do a good job. There was a bunch of weird
37:00
words like it and and the and like that's not a feature. That's definitely not a feature. But this pass worked
37:07
really well once I started to kind of understand the edge cases and say, I
37:13
want you to go and identify all of the best pages. go on the homepage, look for any page with restroom trailers and go
37:20
deep. And it was able to create these cool amenities. And this is what it came up
37:28
with. Tons of different features that would ultimately become the filter uh on
37:34
my directory. So if we check out that page that we're checking out here,
37:40
like I give people the option to choose by stall. So this is the stall data, but
37:47
if we also go back and click on running water, for example,
37:52
it'll just show all of the luxury restroom trailers with that specific amenity. And people can click multiple
37:59
if they want and then sort from there. So that was kind of the reason I chose this one.
38:06
Um, see if there's any sort of mentions here. Um, yeah, like
38:14
this one was pretty straightforward and this didn't really take too much time, but again, massive time saved compared
38:21
to manually doing this. And then the last one was also pretty simple. It was just the service areas. A lot of people
38:27
want to know if a place can drive out like a 100 miles to a remote location
Step 7: Service Areas
38:32
where they're having a outdoor wedding. Um, so yeah, this is the prompt that I wrote
38:39
and just asked it to go and find the service areas. Um, the only challenge
38:46
with this is that some businesses were like in different states. So if a business was based in Florida, sometimes
38:53
the first run would show me like Florida, Texas, Arizona.
38:58
And so I had to make some adjustments. But this is these are the new columns that I
39:04
created. I broke it down by city, region, and radius. So, also just good
39:10
to know for anyone who's shopping around for a luxury restroom trailer. And so,
Niche Directory Ideas: Dementia Care, ADA Bathrooms, Tap Water Quality
39:15
that's pretty much the full sevenstep process. And I think it might be eight
39:21
steps or four steps depending on the type of niche that you're building a directory in or how deep you want to go
39:28
with the data enrichment. But I think if you can just use crawl for AI and cloud
39:34
code, it'll serve you well. And more importantly, it kind of just opened my
39:39
mind up to the types of directories that I can build. Like for a long time, I had
39:44
some ideas where I could go and create like very very niche directories in competitive
39:50
spaces. And we saw a place for mom.com killing it.
39:56
But unless you're like an expert SEO, have unlimited budget for backlinks, and
40:01
have a lot of time to wait, you're not going to rank for senior living homes. But you might rank for senior living
40:08
homes for people with dementia, which if we look on Hrefs actually gets like over
40:13
a,000 monthly searches. So, it's an high ticket niche. You're kind of taking your little pocket of the industry and doing
40:20
that really well. And I think this kind of idea works well because for the
40:26
people looking for this like if they don't assist with dementia, that's a deal breakaker. So what are like the
40:33
deal breaker features that people make decisions off of? And how can we create
40:40
like very specific directories around that? Bathroom contractor, same thing. Super competitive. We got Angie's List
40:46
and Home Guide and all of these other directories. But what about like an ADA accessible bathroom contractor? Like way
40:53
more specific. And now that we have the ability to go and clean and enrich data
40:59
by looking at the website content, like this is all possible now. Um I'm also
41:06
massive nerd of like public databases. Like data.gov has an unreal amount of just public data that's super like
41:14
horrible to use. The UI and experience is rough. Um, this guy named Andy in our community
41:20
built a tap water quality directory, no back links, started it back in I want to
41:26
say November and he's getting over 40,000 monthly visitors. Got accepted
41:31
into Mediavine. selling like water filters through Amazon affiliate
41:38
and yeah, it's super boring, but like air quality directories like there there's a bunch of like mundane but
41:44
important um directory ideas that I think this unlocks. Um and yeah, event
41:52
directories. I think event directories suck. They still suck. Um,
41:57
I uh I don't know if this is like like too much information, but I went to like
42:03
a singles event like four months ago and I went there and I started talking to
42:08
the people. I talked to some guys and I was like, "How did you learn about this event?" And they were like, "Oh, we went through Eventbrite and just scrolled and
42:16
found this event." I'm like, "That's crazy that you do that." Like I just I I that couldn't be me because I feel like
42:23
these event directories are horrible. that now you can essentially set up scrapers that scrape from multiple
42:31
sources and you just create a better version and with the cloud code you can
42:36
make anything that you want. So I think there's an opportunity in event directories as well.
42:43
But um yeah, just to show people the full process. I mean once you get the data, you have the heart of your
42:49
directory at this point. You know, I created a cleaned up version. Uh there's
42:55
tons of data that you're going to get. So I stripped away all the columns of
43:01
data and then I just gave it to cloud code and said, "Hey, use this to create the subbase database. use the exact
43:08
columns and then the fun part started where once you have
43:14
the database you can just go buck wild and create whatever you want and um
43:19
design it however you'd like. So that is the full process. That's the most
43:24
up-to-date way that I've been kind of scraping, cleaning and enriching my
43:30
data. And uh yeah, it's it's the it's the most
43:35
important part. It's just kind of the most boring part as well. So, if you've made it to the end, you're
For Naysayers: Is Building a Directory Worth It in 2026?
43:41
probably you're probably bought into this idea around, okay, a directory could be a really good
43:47
entry point into building something that doesn't require a lot of my time. Uh, it
43:53
could be high value if it's a it's a really good niche. And then I could build a micro SAS to go and, you know,
44:01
really amp up monetization and enterprise value. But I I suspect there
44:08
are some people who are like not bought in. So for the people that are naysayers
44:15
about directories and creating a directory right now, specifically in
44:21
this moment in time in 2026, what do you have to say to them? Yeah, that's a good point. And I would
44:27
actually say if your timeline is to make money in less than 6 months, I would not
44:33
build a directory. And I'm just saying that because I've been building them for a few years and I just want to save
44:39
people the time. With that said, I don't know if there's I'm obviously
44:45
biased, but I don't know if there's a better playground in structured kind of approach to a project where you can
44:52
learn how claude code works and learn SEO and learn how to sell and get into
44:59
the business of lead generation, which will always be around um than directories. And um the first directory
45:07
that I built with cloud code was just a playground for me to learn. And because it's so simple like you're able to
45:17
like use this as like a vehicle to learn that high leverage skill which I think is AI coding and SEO. So, at the end of
45:25
the day, the way that I think about directories is that it is still to this
45:31
day a playground for me to learn how to get people's eyes on my projects. And
45:37
I've built other businesses and I've spent like a lot of money on Facebook ads in my first business. I would argue
45:44
the top three ways to get distribution nowadays are ads, organic social, and
45:49
SEO. Like, those are the big three. So, choose your distribution. And I made the mistake of not focusing on distribution
45:57
first and directories are a distribution first model. They kind of have an unfair advantage when it comes to SEO because
46:04
if I create this directory or when I publish this directory, I kind of have this topical relevance where I have like
46:12
a thousand pages all around luxury restroom trailers. So, it's really easy to start rank So, it's really easy to
46:18
start ranking for luxury restroom trailer Bakersfield, California, and then work my way up to like luxury
46:25
restroom trailers Los Angeles. So, I think it just gives pe it kind of just gives you this really full process of
46:32
like how to take an idea, build an online asset that you can sell if it is
46:39
monetizing. They can monetize in multiple ways. generally pretty high margin. You know, you can do it from
46:46
anywhere in the world and it's pretty low cost now. You can build a directory for under a few hundred bucks. So, in a
46:53
way, these are small bets, but they can be massive businesses as we saw in the very beginning. Um, but again, just to
47:00
save people time, SEO generally takes time, especially if you're just getting started. So, if your timeline is under 6
47:08
months, if you got fired from your job or you need money immediately, I would say
47:15
go to garage sales and flip items or something like that cuz that's what I did when I really needed money. And uh
47:20
yeah, that's what I would say 100%. I think in general, no matter what startup
47:26
idea you're working on, you can't expect it to be overnight. In
47:32
general, no matter what business model, marketplace, social network, mobile app,
47:37
directory, micro SAS, you know, this is a thing that you have to iterate towards
47:44
and find and find the channels and scale it and stuff like that. And some things
47:49
are out of your control too. Um, one thing I wanted to ask before we head out
LLMs, AI Search & the Future of Directories
47:55
was um, in a world where LLMs,
48:00
like you know, you mentioned SEO is is a huge traffic driver for some of these directories. In a world where people are
48:07
finding uh, products and services through LLMs like Perplexity and Chachbt and Gemini,
48:15
you know, where where what is the role directories there, right? cuz you know is chat GBT
48:22
just going to scrape luxury restroomtrailers.com and just put it in there and then how are you going to be able to generate revenue?
48:28
Yeah, totally fair question. Um I would say I have two points on this and the
48:35
first one is that I think if someone's browsing a directory in 2026
48:41
they're sort of past the discovery phase. Like what I think Chat GBT, Perplexity, and all these other LLMs do
48:48
really well is they help you discover things or get more information on the thing. But by the time someone's on a
48:54
directory, I think they're in the decision-m phase. And with any more complex decision where the consequence
49:00
is too much to risk if you mess it up, they're going to do their due diligence and look at all the options. And so this
49:08
can play out in a couple different ways. like senior living homes. Like if you're finding a senior living home for your
49:14
parents, are you just going to go on Chad Gibbt and just like choose the first one? No. You're probably going to
49:21
take your parents preferences in mind and they might have deal breakers like the dementia example. um lawyer,
49:28
anything in like health, finance or legal. The consequence and the risk of
49:33
choosing a bad accountant or financial adviser is just like not worth like you're not
49:41
going to just choose the first option. And so you're going to compare all the options near you. Um and I think that's
49:48
what pushes people to Google and like really go out of their way to look for what could be your directory. Um pricing
49:56
is another thing. anytime someone can save money, I think that drives a lot of um just
50:02
going on Google and looking at directories and um yeah, like that's that's 100% a
50:09
thing. I was listening to the podcast a podcast around like you know these millionaires driving across town for
50:15
cheaper blueberries at the grocery store. Like this is always going to be a problem. And then the second point is
50:21
like local SEO or any version of local SEO hasn't really changed that much. And
50:28
what I mean is LLMs are decent, but if we go to like haircut
50:35
Los Angeles for example, this is now kind of looking at things from an SEO perspective and why
50:41
directories might continue working for a long time. This is a local query and there's not
50:49
really much different like you kind of have your local pack here some sponsored posts but then you have your organic
50:55
listing results but if you say like I don't know hair gel or something like
51:01
that Google's completely changed the way the SERs looks over the years and this is
51:08
the reason why when I build directories I don't choose product based niches because it's way harder um you're just
51:15
competing with so much other content and like socials and all this other stuff.
51:20
So from an SEO perspective, I think like any kind of local SEO is still pretty
51:26
lowhanging fruit and I still think directories are just going
51:32
to be around in some capacity and maybe we'll see a different direction. I don't know if you saw Mark Loose trust MRR,
51:39
but it's essentially a directory and he leveraged his personal brand and audience to create it. But that's been
51:47
going crazy. He turned it into a marketplace where now you can acquire or sell businesses
51:53
kind of playing on this idea that you can monetize. You can monet once you have traffic, you can monetize in any
51:59
way that they want. And people will go out of their way and just email you sometimes and say, "Hey, can you like add this to your directory?" and that
52:05
might inspire a kind of monetization idea. Um, so that's what I would say.
52:11
Uh, but it's definitely a real concern. I'm sure it's going to get way better and we might get to a point with aentic
52:17
search um, where it's just unreal and
52:22
yeah, like we'll we'll we'll have to figure it out at that point. But I don't think lead generation as a business is
52:27
ever going to go away. Yeah, you could make the argument that in a world where people are going to
52:35
LLMs for search or AI search takes over that in fact the niche directories are
52:41
the ones that stay and the ones that are horizontal directories actually
52:47
get hurt because the question the prompting is very very specific
52:55
and what's going to happen is the data uh that you know chat GPT is going to
53:02
have to reference your website no matter what. They can't just like fully steal all your data. So they're going to
53:08
they're going to give you the link. And the beauty is instead of getting, you know, a thousand little blue links
53:15
